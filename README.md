# Data Comparison
This application is intended to compare the data in lookup tables between versions of the database on different servers.

The goal is to schedule a task to run the app daily to catch 
* changes made by users, 
* differences in the results of scripts (be careful with identity insert!), 
* and data changes that need to be rolled.

*The comparison works for views too!*

Create these text files and put them in a folder called **Inputs** under bin\Debug:
* **TablesToCompare**.supersecret
    * list of tables and views to compare
    * one table or view per line
    * Include the schema name and table/view name, separated by a period (example: `dbo.AccountType`).
    * If the schema or table/view name needs brackets, include them (example: `dbo.[View with spaces in name]`).
    * The first column in the table or view must be an integer that uniquely identifies the record.
* **DatabasePairs**.supersecret
    * list of database pairs to compare
    * one database pair per line
    * Include these parts separated by commas:
        * friendly name of first database (example: `Dev` or `Test`)
        * server name for first database
        * name of first database
        * friendly name of second database
        * server name for second database
        * name of second database
    * example: `Dev,DevServerName,DevDBName,Test,TestServerName,TestDBName`
* **ColumnsToIgnore**.supersecret *(optional)*
    * list of columns to ignore
    * default list will be used if list is not provided

The results will go in a folder called **Outputs** under bin\Debug, with one file per database pair per day.

When scheduling the task, put the location of the bin\Debug folder in the **"Start in (optional)"** field.

Command-line arguments:
* flag for silent mode (Use "1" or the word "true" to set silent mode on.)
* different filename for TablesToCompare.supersecret (example: `EnumTables.supersecret` or `MyTables.txt`)
* different filename for DatabasePairs.supersecret
* different filename for ColumnsToIgnore.supersecret

To specify command-line arguments in Visual Studio:
* Right click the project and select Properties.
* Go to the Debug tab.
* Enter the arguments separated by spaces in the "Command line arguments" textbox.
